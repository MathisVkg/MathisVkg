### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
Hello, I am a passionate junior front-end developer with a strong interest in Javascript and React. I enjoy building APIs and databases and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas. I have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and am able to use these technologies to create user interfaces for web applications that are both functional and visually appealing.

I love creating new projects stimulating my abilities and pushing to my limits.
